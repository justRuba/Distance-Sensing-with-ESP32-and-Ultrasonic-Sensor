# Distance-Sensing-with-ESP32-and-Ultrasonic-Sensor
This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances accurately. The measured distance is calculated based on the time it takes for ultrasonic pulses to travel to a target and back, using the speed of sound in air.
